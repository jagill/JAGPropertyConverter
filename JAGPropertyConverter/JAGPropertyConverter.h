/**
   JAGPropertyConverter handles the decomposition of a Model object into an NSDictionary of basic types, and
   the (re)composition of NSDictionaries into model objects.
 
   We use the term _Model_ for a subclass of NSObject with defined @properties.  Although the definition
   is broad, intuitively we mean objects with data that we would like to persist or serialize, corresponding to
   Model in Model-View-Controller.  We use the term _basic type_ for the common objects of Objective-C, including
   NSString, NSNumber, NSArray, etc.  The exact definition of basic depends on the outputType, a JSON-compliant
   NSDictionary has a more restrictive set of allowed types than does a PropertyList dictionary.
 
   JAGPropertyConverter converts a given Model into an NSDictionary, with
   keys equal to the property names and values equal to the property values converted into a basic type.
   A non-collection basic type, such as NSString, is unchanged.  For a basic collection, such as NSArray, NSSet,
   or NSDictionary, the converter goes through each entry and converts it.  For a Model value, the converter
   converties it to an NSDictionary.  If the converter does not know how to handle a value, it drops it.
 
   At the end of the recursive decomposition process, a Model is converted into an NSDictionary whose values
   are all basic types and contain only basic types.  Depending on the outputType, this NSDictionary is
   JSON- or PropertyList- compliant.  The method decomposeObject: can handle an NSArray,
   NSSet, or NSDictionary of Models (or basic types, really).  The method convertToDictionary: is the primitive function
   that converts a Model into a dictionary; decomposeObject: calls that Models that
   it recognizes as candidates for conversion.
 
   The converse of decomposition is composition, which takes an NSDictionary of basic types and converts it
   to a Model.  For whichever properties the Model has which have corresponding keys in the NSDictionary,
   their value is set to the corresponding value in the NSDictionary.  If a value of the NSDictionary is itself
   an NSDictionary, the converter tries to convert it to an appropriate Model object.  Similarly, entries of
   NSArray or NSSet objects are converted as necessary.  Thus composing an NSDictionary to a Model recursively
   handles nested collections/etc.  The method composeModelFromObject: will take an arbitrary object and compose
   it into a Model (or collection thereof), while the method setPropertiesOf:fromDictionary: will set the properties
   of the supplied Model from the supplied NSDictionary.
 
   Different conversion needs are handled by the various properties of JAGPropertyConverter, which specify how
   to handle non-obvious cases.  The most important of these are outputType, identifyDict, and classesToConvert.
 
   - *outputType* specifies what basic types are acceptable, allowing PropertyList or JSON outputs to be targetted.
   - *identifyDict* is how the converter knows what Model class (if any) an NSDictionary should be composed into.
   - *classesToConvert* tells the converter which Model classes it should decompose.
 
   @warning **NB:** JAGPropertyConverter can't currently handle properties whose types are `struct`s, `union`s, blocks,
   function pointers, or `char*`.  As (or if) the need arises, we'll implement support for these.

 * converted and isn't a valid PropertyList value will

 *

 * A block that determines whether and how to convert an NSDictionary
 * into a model object.
 *
 * 
 * When converting from a PropertyList/JSON dictionary/etc, it is not
 * obvious whether an NSDictionary should be left alone or converted to
 * a model object (and if so, to which one).  In the case of an NSDictionary
 * contained within an NSArray or NSDictionary, there is not even defined
 * property class to guide the conversion.
 *
 * This block is called if the converter needs to identify whether an
 * NSDictionary should be converted to a model object.  If the block returns
 * a Class, the NSDictionary is used to set a Class instance's properties.
 * If the block returns nil, then the NSDictionary is "converted"
 * by returning an NSDictionary with its values converted recursively.
 * 
 * Example:  If the converter is trying to convert a dictionary
 * `dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2}`, and
 * `identifyDict(dict)==[MyClass class]`, dict will be converted to
 * an instance myClass with `myClass.key1==value1`, `myClass.key2==value2`.
 * If `identifyDict(dict)==nil`, dict will be "converted"
 * to an NSDictionary with each value converted.
